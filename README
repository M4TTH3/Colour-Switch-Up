# Created by Matthew Au-Yeung for ICS-3UI
# Each round in a grid of 4x4, a colour of random will be chosen.
# Player must move to the tile that contains that colour
# Obstacles will be in the way, and can explode launching character.
# Countdown from 10 (may change) to move to that tile


# main.py


# initiate variables

# while loop sets start screen

# while loop runs game
# before loop set tile grid in array, score, player, obstacles
# update colours
# update obstacles

# while loop end game


# game.py


# class game_object: (Abstract)

# init: super variables of x, y, hitbox, screen, img.
# use object to draw them all easily and compare hitboxes

# draw_obj(): function draws image onto screen


# class tile(game_object):
# init: colour_str
# colour_str used to determines colour and for booleans

# update_colour(self, colour_str): updates colour

# the draw function will contain if to adjust colour based on string


# class player(game_object):

# init: explode_s_time = 0, velocity_x, velocity_y, slope

# update_coord(self, x, y): this will update the characters values

# check_collision(self, game_object): Will take in object eg. tile/rock to check whether it's hit.
# check if object is safe from elimination or can't move past it, respectively.

# get_slope(self, obstacle):
# updates slope

# explode_movement():
# will set velocity dependent on slope


# class obstacle(game_object):

# init: variable center (origin, used to determine angle to send it flying using slope)

# explode(self, player):
# time.time() =
